# CS361
CS361 Software Engineering Project

In this project, I will create a machine learning model to detect brain tumors based on MRIs.
The model set up and training will be through Google colab to help manage the process and alleviate issues with doing this locally.
I will use the model through a simple website that will host an API for the model to be passed images.
